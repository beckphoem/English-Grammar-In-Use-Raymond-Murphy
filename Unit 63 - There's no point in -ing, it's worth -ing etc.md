We say:

|------|------|
| there's no point in<br>it's no use<br>it's no good | doing something |

- There's no point in having a car if you never use it.

- There was no point in waiting any longer, so we left.
- It's no use worrying about what happened. There's nothing you can do about it.
- It's no good trying to persuade me. You won't succeed.

We say **'no point in ...'** but **'the point of...'**:
- There's **no point in** having a car.
- What's **the point of** having a car if you never use it?
